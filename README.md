# Clickygame

This is a memory game that tests whether a user can click through all 12 images without clicking the same image more than once. My app uses a theme of drag queens from Rupaul's Drag Race. The user clicks on an image and as long as the images are different each time, the score increases by one. If the user clicks a duplicate image, the game ends. The game restarts using a button on the top of the screen.
